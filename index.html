                I am a 21 year old male with an Assosiates in General Science currently attending a University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp.
                I have taught myself a few coding launguages such as C, Java, Python and have taken a course in Data Structures
                for Java. Before taking this Bootcamp course I thought CSS stood for Can Script Sometimes. I really like
                spaghetti and taco tuesday should be cancelled.
