                I am a 21 year old male with an Assosiates in General Science currently attending a University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. 
                I have taught myself a few coding launguages such as C, Java, Python and have taken a course in Data Structures for Java. Before 
                taking this Bootcamp course I thought CSS stood for Can Script Sometimes. I really like spaghetti and taco tuesday should be cancelled.
